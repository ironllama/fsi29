# 1. Get a 3-digit number from the user. Ask that all three digits are
#     different numbers. Store this number in a variable called 'first_num'.

# 2. Validate that all 3 digits are different numbers. If not, instruct
#    the user to run the exercise again with a valid number and stop
#    running the rest of the code by calling 'exit()'.

# 3. Reverse the 3 digits in first_num, without using the list 'reverse'
#    or 'reversed' functions. Use only what you've learned so far.
#    Save this reversed number in another variable called 'second_num'.

# 4. Subtract second_num from first_num and store the result in another
#    variable called 'third_num'. If third_num is a negative number
#    turn it into a positive number.

# 5. Reverse third_num and save it to a variable called 'fourth_num'.

# 6. Add third_num and fourth_num and print out the result. (1089)

# 7. Subtract the lesser number of first_num and second_num from the
#    greater number of first_num and second_num so that you end up
#    with a positive number for the difference. Save this difference
#    in a variable called 'fs_diff'.

# 8. Add up the individual digits that make up fs_diff and print out
#    the resulting sum. (18)
