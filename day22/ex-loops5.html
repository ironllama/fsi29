    1. At the beginning, we have $1000
    Loop:
    2. We choose a number to bet on (1 ~ 36)

    3. We decide an amount of money to bet (1 ~ currentMoney)

    4. We generate a random number between 0 ~ 36 (inclusive)

    5. Check IF winner:
        a. Same number -> multiply bet * 36;
        b. If both ODD or both EVEN -> multiply bet * 2
        c. Otherwise we lose the bet

    6. We add or subtract the money, as needed
        a. If we run out of money, game is over.

    7. Ask the player if they want to continue
