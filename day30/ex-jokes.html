        // Use the following API endpoint to create a webpage that shows jokes. Try accessing the endpoint on the browser first, to get an idea of the payload.  Then using this information, create your webpage with the following behavior:

        // - Only show the 'setup' until the user interacts with the screen. This interaction can be clicking on something or somewhere, or hitting a key, or hovering over something, etc. Up to you what the interaction will be.

        // - After the interaction, the UI will reveal the 'punchline'.

        // BONUS: Provide something on the UI that will allow resetting of the screen to show another joke. Try to do this without refreshing or reloading the page, but with JS resetting the UI and requesting another joke.

        // API: https://official-joke-api.appspot.com/random_joke
