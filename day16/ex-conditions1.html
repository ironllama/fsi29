    // There have been sightings of a werewolf in your sleepy little countryside village. You have been tasked to create a warning system for its residents so they can be warned of a full moon. To test your system's logic, have your program generate a random hour of the day. Then generate a random state of the moon (full or not full). These are the expected outcomes:
    // If it is a day time hour, wish the user a good day.
    // If the hour is considered night (dark outside) and the moon is full, generate a warning about werewolves. (eg. "The moon is full, beware of werewolves!")
    // If the hour is considered night (dark outside), and the moon is NOT full, wish the user a pleasant evening.

    let hour = Math.floor(Math.random() * 24);
    let fullmoon = Math.random() > 0.5;

    let night = false;
    if (hour < 6 || hour > 18) {
        night = true;
    }

    // For debugging, let's output variables.
    console.log("H:", hour, "FM:", fullmoon, "N:", night);
